✂️ Just Launched: Barber Shop AI Assistant 🚀💈

I’m excited to share a new project I’ve been working on – an AI-powered Barber Shop Assistant built using n8n + DeepSeek Chat (v3-0324) via OpenRouter AI.

🔧 Tech Stack:
 • LLM: DeepSeek Chat v3 (via OpenRouter)
 • Platform: n8n (No-code/Low-code workflow automation)
 • Memory: OpenRouter Chat Simple Memory
 • Utility Nodes: Date & Time, Tool integration, Output Parser

🤖 What It Can Do:
 • 📅 Books Appointments for services like haircut, beard trim, grooming
 • 🧑‍🦱 Asks for Customer Info: Name, Preferred Time & Date
 • 💇‍♂️ Lets You Choose Your Barber from given options
 • 💸 Applies Discount Offers dynamically
 • 🛠️ Planned Additions: WhatsApp notifications to owner, database integration for customer management

This project demonstrates how Agentic AI can be applied in local businesses to automate customer interaction and enhance booking workflows.

I’m open to feedback, collaborations, or internship opportunities in AI/Automation!
Let me know what you think. 🙌
